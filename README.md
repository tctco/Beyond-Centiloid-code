To use the DCCC python interface or try out the Abeta pattern model, you are required to download [trained models and example data](https://github.com/tctco/Beyond-Centiloid-code/releases/tag/v0.1) from the Release page.

For AD PET decomposition experiments, check [AD_decouple.ipynb](https://github.com/tctco/Beyond-Centiloid-code/blob/main/py/AD_decouple.ipynb) notebook.

For DCCC experiments, check [abeta_pattern.ipynb](https://github.com/tctco/Beyond-Centiloid-code/blob/main/py/abeta_pattern.ipynb) and [fdg_classifier_eval.ipynb](https://github.com/tctco/Beyond-Centiloid-code/blob/main/py/fdg_classifier_eval.ipynb) notebooks.

DCCC cpp version source code is in [./cpp](https://github.com/tctco/Beyond-Centiloid-code/tree/main/cpp), you may need to compile it if you wish to run it on MAC or Linux.
